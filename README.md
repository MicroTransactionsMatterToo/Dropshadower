#### FAQ
- Q: My dropshadows look odd and aren't smooth
  A: The quality of the dropshadows depends on which assets you are using. Low resolution assets, particularly those that don't have smooth edges, will cause artifacts in shadows. Unfortunately, this incldues the default assets. Forgotten Adventures assets are known to work very well with the mod

  A: This feature will be added in future
